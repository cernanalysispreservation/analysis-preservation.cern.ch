JSON Schema Reference
=====================

The analysis information is modelled in the JSON schema to ensure data is added in the structure and formatting predefined by physicists from the collaboration - in collaboration with the CERN Analysis Preservation team. The platform draws inspiration from the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) recommended practices to ensure long-term preservation of captured assets.

Each schema is directly provided or created with support by collaboration physicists and tested as well as revised several times to ensure that important information will be preserved. Throughout this process core components of an analysis are identified and structured. Hence, each collaboration has its own unique schema to capture the workflow that fits their requirements and a flexible design of the schema allows each working group to tailor their input according to their specific requirements. The flexibility provided allows to ensure that the core components of the analysis are captured. You can duplicate, delete, ignore and create content within the constraints of the schema. 

Every schema change is versioned, ensuring that the schema can be adapted to work with new ways of doing analysis at any moment in time without breaking older analysis records.

Depending on the preference and work environment of the researcher, analysis information can be created and edited through a :ref:`project-submission-form` on the web interface or via the :ref:`project-rest-api`.
