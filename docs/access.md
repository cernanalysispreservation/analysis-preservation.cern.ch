# Authorisation and Access Control

Authorization on CAP is managed by CERN Single Sign-On, therefore applying the usual access restrictions you are used to from your collaboration.

Due to the sensitive nature of analysis information and content - especially in early stages of an analysis - accessibility of analysis information is subject to permissions set by the collaborations, as well as the creator of an analysis and the collaborators involved.

When starting a new analysis submission to CAP, the analysis record is saved as a draft. By default, the creator of the draft record will be the only one able to view and edit it. Read or edit rights can be granted to researchers in the analysis team or the working group.

As soon as the analysis is "published", the analysis will be shared with the collaboration, meaning its members will acquire rights to view the analysis. Editing rights will remain as they were for the draft.

A draft version can be submitted any time. We encourage you to deposit the analysis as soon as possible so that it becomes "visible" to the members of your collaboration (and no one else). However, these decisions are up to you and the collaboration's practices.

More specifically:

- only collaboration members have access to a collaboration's area, can create analyses and can see shared analyses
- only a certain collaboration's members have access to this collaboration's analyses
- only members granted specific rights can see or edit a draft version of an analysis
- only the creator can see or edit an analysis with default permission settings
