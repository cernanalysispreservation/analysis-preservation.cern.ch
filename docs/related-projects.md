# Related Projects

CERN Analysis Preservation is related to a couple of projects, some of which may come up in discussions and are therefore listed here:

###### [CERN Open Data portal](http://opendata.cern.ch/)

The CERN Open Data Portal is an open access portal for publishing output from various research activities, includes accompanying software and documentation needed to understand and analyse the data. It serves as a learning platform as well as enabling further research and exploration.

###### [DASPOS](http://daspos.org/)
The Data and Software Preservation for Open Science. A project to explore preservation possibilities and techniques in High-Energy physics.

###### [DPHEP](https://www.dphep.org/)
Data Preservation in High Energy Physics. A study group to explore preservation possibilities and techniques in High-Energy Physics.

###### [HEPData](https://www.hepdata.net/)
An open access portal preserving and providing data, plots and tables from publications in High-Energy Physics.

###### [Invenio](http://inveniosoftware.org/>)
An open source digital library framework that CERN Analysis Preservation is based on. It provides background functionality like authorization, working with analysis records and storage.

###### [REANA](https://reana.io/)
REANA or Reusable Analysis is a system that schedules and runs analyses on the CERN cloud based on Kubernetes and Yadage Workflows. It is used to rerun analyses from CERN Analysis Preservation and RECAST.

###### [RECAST](http://recast.perimeterinstitute.ca/)
A service based on requests to re-execute an analysis chain with the possibility of using a new signal model. Analysis chains are defined and stored as JSON workflows on CERN Analysis Preservation and rerun using REANA. An analysis is wrapped inside a Docker container.
