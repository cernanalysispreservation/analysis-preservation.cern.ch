======

To build this documentation with Sphinx you have to follow a few simple steps.

Setup the Environment
---------------------

If you only want to build the docs and you do not want to run the code or you want to keep these tasks in separate environments, continue with the following.

First, install the necessary requirements:

.. code-block:: console

	python python-virtualenvwrapper

Second, clone the repository (or your own fork) if you have not done so already:

.. code-block:: console

	git clone https://github.com/cernanalysispreservation/analysispreservation.cern.ch.git cap

Third, create the virtual environment:

.. code-block:: console

	mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 capdocs

and install Sphinx:

.. code-block:: console

	pip install Sphinx

Now you are all set. Whenever you want to build your docs in the future, just follow the below instructions.

Build the Docs
--------------

To build the docs, switch into the docs folder inside your repository folder

.. code-block:: console

	cd ~/PATH_TO_YOUR_CLONED_FOLDER/cap/docs

and run

.. code-block:: console

	make html

If that does not work and you do not see the ``(capdocs)`` in your terminal as such:

.. code-block:: console

	(capdocs) [USER@COMPUTER cap]$

then do the following:

.. code-block:: console

	workon capdocs
	make html

Spell-Check the Docs
--------------------

One possibility to spell-check the docs directly from your command line is to install:

.. code-block:: console

	hunspell hunspell-en

and run:

.. code-block:: console

	find . -type f -name '*.rst' -exec hunspell -d en_GB -l {} \;

from within the docs folder on your command line. This will give you a list of words possibly spelled incorrectly.
