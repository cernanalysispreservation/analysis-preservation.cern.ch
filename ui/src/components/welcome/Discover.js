                CERN Analysis Preservation (CAP) is a service for physicists to
                preserve and document the various materials produced in the
                process of their analyses, e.g. datasets, code, documentation,
                so that they are reusable and understandable in the future. By
                using this tool, researchers ensure these outputs are preserved
                and also findable and accessible by their (internal)
                collaborators.
