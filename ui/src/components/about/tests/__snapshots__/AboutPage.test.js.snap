                                                  CERN Analysis Preservation (CAP) is a service for physicists to preserve and document the various materials produced in the process of their analyses, e.g. datasets, code, documentation, so that they are reusable and understandable in the future. By using this tool, researchers ensure these outputs are preserved and also findable and accessible by their (internal) collaborators.

                                                  To make the tool as easy to use as possible, an API and a dedicated client are available, as well as integrations with existing databases and platforms used by the collaborations. This shall help reducing the burden on the HEP researchers and to avoid duplication of information. The researchers remain in full control of their datasets while being able to preserve and share their data and materials easily with their colleagues.

                                                CERN Analysis Preservation (CAP) is a service for physicists to preserve and document the various materials produced in the process of their analyses, e.g. datasets, code, documentation, so that they are reusable and understandable in the future. By using this tool, researchers ensure these outputs are preserved and also findable and accessible by their (internal) collaborators.

                                                To make the tool as easy to use as possible, an API and a dedicated client are available, as well as integrations with existing databases and platforms used by the collaborations. This shall help reducing the burden on the HEP researchers and to avoid duplication of information. The researchers remain in full control of their datasets while being able to preserve and share their data and materials easily with their colleagues.

                                                CAP is now in Beta phase. We welcome everyone to test and use the system. For more details about how to use CAP, the documentation for the service can be found at

                                          CERN Analysis Preservation (CAP) is a service for physicists to preserve and document the various materials produced in the process of their analyses, e.g. datasets, code, documentation, so that they are reusable and understandable in the future. By using this tool, researchers ensure these outputs are preserved and also findable and accessible by their (internal) collaborators.

                                          To make the tool as easy to use as possible, an API and a dedicated client are available, as well as integrations with existing databases and platforms used by the collaborations. This shall help reducing the burden on the HEP researchers and to avoid duplication of information. The researchers remain in full control of their datasets while being able to preserve and share their data and materials easily with their colleagues.

                                CERN Analysis Preservation (CAP) is a service for physicists to preserve and document the various materials produced in the process of their analyses, e.g. datasets, code, documentation, so that they are reusable and understandable in the future. By using this tool, researchers ensure these outputs are preserved and also findable and accessible by their (internal) collaborators.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                                To make the tool as easy to use as possible, an API and a dedicated client are available, as well as integrations with existing databases and platforms used by the collaborations. This shall help reducing the burden on the HEP researchers and to avoid duplication of information. The researchers remain in full control of their datasets while being able to preserve and share their data and materials easily with their colleagues.

                    CERN Analysis Preservation (CAP) is a service for physicists to preserve and document the various materials produced in the process of their analyses, e.g. datasets, code, documentation, so that they are reusable and understandable in the future. By using this tool, researchers ensure these outputs are preserved and also findable and accessible by their (internal) collaborators.
</Paragraph>,
                  <Paragraph>
                    To make the tool as easy to use as possible, an API and a dedicated client are available, as well as integrations with existing databases and platforms used by the collaborations. This shall help reducing the burden on the HEP researchers and to avoid duplication of information. The researchers remain in full control of their datasets while being able to preserve and share their data and materials easily with their colleagues.

                                        As we are preserving sensitive data, we apply safety measures and access control to all information added to CAP. Access will always be restricted to members of the collaboration associated with an analysis. Permissions within a collaboration can be adjusted by the creator of the analysis, defaulting to creator-only access. More specifically:

                                                            CERN Analysis Preservation (CAP) is a service for physicists to preserve and document the various materials produced in the process of their analyses, e.g. datasets, code, documentation, so that they are reusable and understandable in the future. By using this tool, researchers ensure these outputs are preserved and also findable and accessible by their (internal) collaborators.
                                                </Paragraph>

                                                            To make the tool as easy to use as possible, an API and a dedicated client are available, as well as integrations with existing databases and platforms used by the collaborations. This shall help reducing the burden on the HEP researchers and to avoid duplication of information. The researchers remain in full control of their datasets while being able to preserve and share their data and materials easily with their colleagues.

                                                        CERN Analysis Preservation (CAP) is a service for physicists to preserve and document the various materials produced in the process of their analyses, e.g. datasets, code, documentation, so that they are reusable and understandable in the future. By using this tool, researchers ensure these outputs are preserved and also findable and accessible by their (internal) collaborators.

                                                        To make the tool as easy to use as possible, an API and a dedicated client are available, as well as integrations with existing databases and platforms used by the collaborations. This shall help reducing the burden on the HEP researchers and to avoid duplication of information. The researchers remain in full control of their datasets while being able to preserve and share their data and materials easily with their colleagues.

                                                CERN Analysis Preservation (CAP) is a service for physicists to preserve and document the various materials produced in the process of their analyses, e.g. datasets, code, documentation, so that they are reusable and understandable in the future. By using this tool, researchers ensure these outputs are preserved and also findable and accessible by their (internal) collaborators.

                                                To make the tool as easy to use as possible, an API and a dedicated client are available, as well as integrations with existing databases and platforms used by the collaborations. This shall help reducing the burden on the HEP researchers and to avoid duplication of information. The researchers remain in full control of their datasets while being able to preserve and share their data and materials easily with their colleagues.

                                    CERN Analysis Preservation (CAP) is a service for physicists to preserve and document the various materials produced in the process of their analyses, e.g. datasets, code, documentation, so that they are reusable and understandable in the future. By using this tool, researchers ensure these outputs are preserved and also findable and accessible by their (internal) collaborators.

                                            As we are preserving sensitive data, we apply safety measures and access control to all information added to CAP. Access will always be restricted to members of the collaboration associated with an analysis. Permissions within a collaboration can be adjusted by the creator of the analysis, defaulting to creator-only access. More specifically:
